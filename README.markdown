# PHP i18n
This is a simple i18n class for PHP. Nothing fancy, but fast, because it uses caching. Try it out!

## Setup
To use the i18n class, look at the example.php. You will find there a simple tutorial for this class.

## Fork it!
Please fork this project and help me with the development. For example you could work on a better API for this ;)
