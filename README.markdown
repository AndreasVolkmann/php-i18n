# PHP i18n
This is a simple i18n class for PHP. Nothing fancy, but fast, because it uses caching and it is easy to use. Try it out!

Some of its features:

* Translations in ini-files
* Caching makes it very fast
* Simple API (`L::category_stringname`)
* Simplicity ;)

## Setup
To use the i18n class, look at the example.php. You will find there a simple tutorial for this class.

## Fork it!
Please fork this project and help me with the development.
